Emerald Hunt - Help File
============

Introduction
------------

   To run Emerald Hunt you need an EGA compatible graphics adapter.
You do NOT need a mouse or joystick, instead you use the keyboard's
arrow keys. Emerald Hunt is not a shoot-em-up or mindless action game.
It requires considerable skill but is essentially simple to understand.
If you want help on how to play the game, select YES when asked after
the initial banner page.

Files on disk
-------------

   HUNT.EXE        - Emerald Hunt
   OBJECTS.DAT     - Graphics objects
   BUILDOBJ.EXE    - Utility to edit OBJECTS.DAT
   BUILD.EXE       - Utility to edit screens
   *.PIC           - Screen picture files

Notes and Hints
---------------

   The characters that appear on the screen (boulders, bombs etc.) can
be modified to look any way you wish. To do this use BUILDOBJ.EXE.
However, make sure you backup OBJECTS.DAT in case you want to go back
to the original objects.
   On the main menu of Emerald Hunt is an option to load a saved game.
This is for resuming a game you previously saved or a game you have
specially created using BUILD.EXE. If you are inclined to cheat, you
can save a game you are playing then edit it with BUILD.EXE.
   Below are some general hints on good playing strategies :-
     - beware of objects that roll off other objects
     - collect any diamonds (the blue ones) that are exposed before
         doing anything else, as they may be squashed
     - conserve grenades for emergencies
     - use bombs as much as possible for clearing boulders and stone
     - be careful not to bury valuable gems too much as it may become
         impossible to collect them
     - work from the bottom up
     - bugs always follow terrain on their left, so make sure you know
         where they will be so you can keep out of their way.
