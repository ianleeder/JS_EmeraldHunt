  The object of this game is to collect as many emeralds
and diamonds as possible without being killed in the process.
Once your score reaches the goal amount you then proceed
to the exit. You score 1 point for an emerald and 5 points
for a diamond.
  Events that will kill you are as follows :-
       1. Any falling object hitting you on the head, or
       2. A bomb or grenade exploding next to you, or
       3. A bug being within a 1 unit radius of you.
  Objects that fall due to gravity are: boulders, emeralds
diamonds and bombs. Any piece of dirt, bricks, stone and
yourself will support any number of these objects. However,
some objects on top of other objects are unstable and thus
they roll off each other. An object is unstable if :
       1. it is resting on a non-flat surface, and
       2. there is nothing supporting the object either
	      to it's left or it's right.
  Bombs, grenades and bugs are explodable objects. When they
explode, everything in a one unit radius is destroyed except
bricks. If another explodable object is within this radius, it
also explodes, causing a chain reaction. Bugs can be killed by
dropping an object such as a boulder onto them. Grenades are
collected just like emeralds or diamonds but are detonated
using the space bar. After a certain delay the grenade explodes.
