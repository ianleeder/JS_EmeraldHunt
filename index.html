				Back in 2014 I couldn't find a copy of the original EmeraldHunt game that I fondly remembered from my childhood.
			</p>
			<p>
				As a challenge to myself, and to work on my JavaScript skills, I decided to rewrite the game in native JavaScript
				(no additional libraries).
			</p>
			<p>
				I've since found the original game files, and uploaded them to <a href="http://www.abandonia.com/en/games/31445/Emerald+Hunt.html">Abandonia</a>.
